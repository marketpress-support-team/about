# About
Why this account exists separately from https://github.com/inpsyde

----

One word: **[Gists](https://gist.github.com/marketpress-support-team)**.

As a support team, we need to publish a code snippet here and there. GitHub currently doesn’t support publishing Gists as an organization, so there’s that. Gists are pretty much all this account will be ever used for.
